# Auto MLAG on Controlling Bridge platforms
This tool configures MLAG on vpex enabled/disabled switches.

### Description
This script detects peer connected links thru lldp and configures LACP on PEER links and creates ISC_VLAN with IP Address. And associates the ISC_VLAN to the MLAG
This script has to be executed on both PEERs

**Please review the configuration before loading the configuration on a switch**

### Files
* [The Core Python Script - auto_mlag.py](auto_mlag.py)
* [README.md](README.md)

### Requirements
Firmware: ExtremeXOS(TM)
This script was tested on 31.5 and older.

### Features
* This Script can only run on EXOS. 
 

### How to use
* download this script to the switches PEER-1 and PEER-2
* Execute the script on PEER-1 Ex: 'run script auto_mlag.py'
* Wait for the PEER-1 execution to get completed
* Now execute the script on PEER-2
* The above steps completes the MLAG configuration.
* You shall enable "vpex auto-configuration" to attach BPEs to the MLAG switches 

### NOTE :
* script does not work, if more than one peer is connected
* do not run this script parallel on both PEERs. You have to run the script on PEER-1 first.
* Once it completes on PEER-1, then start to execute on PEER2
* **Below are the PEER IPs and VLAN details variable used in the script. It can be changed based on the requirement.**
```
peer_ip_list = ['169.254.0.1/16', '169.254.0.2']
isc_vlan = {'name' : 'isc_mlag', 'tag' : '4094', 'mode' : 'tagged'}
```

## EXOS run example:
Execution on PEER-1 :

```
* (CIT_31.6.0.404) X465-24MU.13 # run script auto_mlag.py
[+] Port(s) connected to the peer : 26, 28
Warning: Any config on the master port is lost (STP, IGMP Filter, IGMP Static Group, MAC-Security, CFM, etc.)

[+] enable sharing 26 grouping 26, 28 lacp
Error: VLAN isc_mlag does not have primary address!
[+] Peer IP is not available
[+] Local IP 169.254.0.1/16
[+] MLAG created
```

Execution on PEER-2:

```
* (CIT_31.6.0.412) X465-24XE.2 # run script auto_mlag.py
[+] Port(s) connected to the peer : 22, 24
Warning: Any config on the master port is lost (STP, IGMP Filter, IGMP Static Group, MAC-Security, CFM, etc.)

[+] enable sharing 22 grouping 22, 24 lacp
Error: VLAN isc_mlag does not have primary address!
[+] Peer IP available 169.254.0.1/16
[+] Local IP 169.254.0.2
[+] MLAG created
* (CIT_31.6.0.412) X465-24XE.3 # show mlag peer
